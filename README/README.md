I made a todo list where you can add tasks, cross them off as done and also remove tasks from the list. The number of all tasks on the list (done and not done) is shown in the application as tasks are added or removed. From the select menu, it is also possible to filter done, undone or all tasks. If the user tries to enter less than two letters in the input field, an error message will appear and the task will not be added to the list. The same also applies in the situation if the input has already been added to the to-do list and this is also necessary for the functionality of the program. LocalStorage has also been added to this application so that the tasks are saved in the browser. I also added a button with which it is possible to clear the entire task list. Confirm alert also ensures the user that he definitely wants to delete the entire task list.

Such a really simple application could very likely be developed with a smaller amount of code and a smarter implementation, but on the other hand, but I think it works well.

I think the project meets excellent requirements and shows a deep understanding of the subject, at least considering that it is the basics of javascript. The user experience in the application is also good in all its simplicity. The filling interface is also pleasing to the eye and easy to use.

Of course, the teacher knows better how well the program is actually implemented, so I would be happy to receive feedback on this project and possible errors in the program.
